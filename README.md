# Modern Sidebar Collapse and Responsive Menu

This repository contains a practice project where I implemented a modern sidebar with collapse and expand functionality, along with a responsive design for mobile devices.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to create a visually appealing and functional sidebar that enhances user navigation. Key features include:

* **Click-to-Collapse/Expand:** The sidebar can be easily collapsed or expanded with a simple click, providing more screen real estate when needed.
* **Modern Design:** The styling incorporates contemporary design principles for a clean and user-friendly interface.
* **Responsive Layout:** On smaller screens (like mobile devices), the sidebar transforms into a bottom navigation menu, ensuring optimal usability across different screen sizes.
* **Sub-Menus:** The sidebar supports nested sub-menus, allowing for the organization of a larger number of navigation links.

## Inspiration

This project was created by following a fantastic tutorial from the **Coding2Go** YouTube channel. I highly recommend checking out their channel for more excellent web development tutorials!
